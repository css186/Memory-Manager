# Memory-Manager

### Project Description

This project is a simulation program for storing, managing records and handling memory allocation and data retrieval using a combination of a hash table and a memory manager.

Here is a breakdown of its components and functionality:

### Core Functionality

1. Hash Table (`HashTable.java`)

   - Uses **quadratic probing** for collision resolution.
   - Stores Record objects that pair seminar IDs with **memory handles**.
   - Automatically resizes when the load factor exceeds a threshold.

2. Memory Manager(`MemManager.java`)

   - Manages a dynamic byte array (memory pool) to store serialized seminar data.
   - Uses a free block list (doubly linked list) to track available memory blocks.
   - **Allocates memory for new records, splits free blocks if necessary, and merges adjacent blocks when freeing memory.**
   - Expands the memory pool incrementally when space runs out.

3. Seminar Object (`Seminar.java`)

   - Represents seminar data (ID, title, date, location, cost, keywords, etc.).
   - Supports serialization/deserialization to convert objects to/from byte streams for storage in the memory pool.

4. Controller (`Controller.java`)

   - Coordinates interactions between the hash table and memory manager.
   - Implements operations: insert, search, delete, print (hash table or free blocks).

5. Command Processor (`CommandProcessor.java`)
   - Parses input files containing commands (insert, search, delete, print).
   - Executes commands by invoking the controller.

### Key Workflows

1. Insert

   - Serializes the seminar into a byte array.
   - Allocates memory via MemManager and stores the data.
   - Updates the hash table with the ID and memory handle.

2. Search

   - Retrieves the handle from the hash table using the ID.
   - Fetches the byte array from memory and deserializes it into a Seminar object.

3. Delete

   - Removes the ID from the hash table.
   - Marks the associated memory block as free (merged with adjacent blocks if possible).

4. Memory Management
   - Uses a **best-fit** strategy to allocate memory from the free block list.
   - **Merges adjacent free blocks during insert and remove operations to reduce fragmentation.**

### Program Invocation

The program will be invoked from the command line as:
`java SemMananager {initial-memory-size} {initial-hash-size} {command-file}`

- Correct and complete format of input files can be referenced with text files having the `_input.txt` postfix
